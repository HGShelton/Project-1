# Project-1
Having gathered this data, we conducted t-tests to determine whether there was a significant difference in the mean amount of crime between the two samples. Significance was determined at a 95% confidence level, meaning any results with a p-value of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Both two-sided and one-sided t-tests were calculated, with most results indicating a lower mean average of crime within a mile radius of public institutions.

## For Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Manhattan,
* The mean number of **all crimes** within a 1 mile radius of **all public institutions** is significantly *lower* than the mean number of all crimes within a 1 mile radius of a random location across all categories of crime.
## In Queens,
* The mean number of **robberies** within a 1 mile radius of **all public institutions** were significantly *lower* than the mean number of robberies within a 1 mile radius of a random location.
* The mean number of **all crimes** within a 1 mile radius of a **library** was significantly *lower* than the mean number of all crimes within a 1 mile radius of a random location.
* The mean number of **robberies** within a 1 mile radius of a **park** were significantly *lower* than the mean number of robberies within a 1 mile radius of a random location.
## For Staten Island,
* The mean amount of **murder/manslaughter** and **total crime** was significantly *lower* around **libraries** and the same can be said about robbery and total crime around outdoor public places.
